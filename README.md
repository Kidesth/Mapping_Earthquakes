# Mapping_Earthquakes
## overview
The purpose of this project is to show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days.using the JavaScript and the D3.js library to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data. You'll use the Leaflet library to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request and create interactivity for the earthquake data.
